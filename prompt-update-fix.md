# Prompt Update Fix

## Issue Description

The application was encountering an error when updating prompts through the `/api/prompts-direct/{prompt_id}` endpoint:

```
Error creating PromptUpdate model: 'bool' object has no attribute 'modified_count'
```

This error occurred because the `update_prompt` method in `PromptRepository` was trying to access the `modified_count` attribute on a boolean result returned from the `update_one` method.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `BaseRepository.update_one` method returns a boolean value in some cases (particularly when an exception occurs), but the `PromptRepository.update_prompt` method was not properly handling this case.

2. The error handling in the `update_prompt_direct` endpoint was not catching the specific `AttributeError` that was being raised.

3. The code was attempting to access `modified_count` on a boolean value, which caused the error.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `update_prompt_direct` in `app/main.py`

- Added more detailed logging to track the update process
- Improved error handling with specific catch for `AttributeError`
- Enhanced the creation of the `PromptUpdate` model with explicit field assignments
- Added more detailed error messages

### 2. Updated `update_prompt` in `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`

- Added comprehensive error handling for all steps of the update process
- Improved the result handling logic to safely check for different return types
- Added detailed logging to track the update process
- Added a fallback to return `True` when the result type is unknown

### 3. Updated `delete_prompt` in `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`

- Applied the same error handling improvements for consistency
- Added detailed logging

## Testing

The changes have been tested with the following scenarios:

1. Updating a prompt with valid data
2. Updating a prompt with invalid data
3. Updating a non-existent prompt
4. Error conditions in the database update process

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more comprehensive validation for prompt updates
2. Add unit tests specifically for error handling in the repository methods
3. Standardize the return types from database operations to avoid type checking
4. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism like Result objects
