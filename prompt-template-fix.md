# Prompt Template Fix

## Problem

The application was encountering an error when using the database prompt for resume optimization:

```
Input to PromptTemplate is missing variables {'\\n                    ## RECOMMENDED SKILLS TO ADD\\n\\n                    The following skills were identified as potentially valuable for this position but may be missing or not prominently featured in the resume'}.
```

This error occurred because the code was treating the placeholder `{recommended_skills_section}` in the template as a variable that needed to be passed to the PromptTemplate, but it was actually a placeholder that should be replaced with the actual recommended skills section.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `resume_optimization` prompt template in the database contained a placeholder `{recommended_skills_section}` that was meant to be replaced with the actual recommended skills section.

2. In `model_ai.py`, the code was replacing this placeholder with the actual recommended skills section, but the PromptTemplate was still treating it as a variable.

3. The `variables` list for the prompt included `"recommended_skills_section"` as a variable, but it was actually a placeholder.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `model_ai.py`

- Modified the code to handle different formats of the placeholder (`{recommended_skills_section}`, `{{recommended_skills_section}}`, and `{{{recommended_skills_section}}}`)
- Added better error handling to catch and report any issues with the prompt template
- Used `template_format="jinja2"` and `partial_variables={}` to ensure proper template processing

### 2. Updated `prompt_repository.py`

- Modified the `initialize_default_prompts` method to ensure the template uses double curly braces for the recommended skills section placeholder
- Removed `"recommended_skills_section"` from the variables list since it's not a real variable

### 3. Created a Fix Script

- Created a script `fix_prompts.py` to update existing prompts in the database
- The script replaces `{recommended_skills_section}` with `{{recommended_skills_section}}` in the template
- The script also updates the variables list to remove `"recommended_skills_section"`

## Testing

The changes have been tested with the following scenarios:

1. Using a prompt template from the database with the recommended skills section placeholder
2. Using a prompt template without the recommended skills section placeholder
3. Error conditions in the template processing

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive validation for prompt templates in the database
2. Add a test suite for prompt template processing
3. Add a UI for testing prompt templates before saving them to the database
