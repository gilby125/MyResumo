# Progress Tracking

## 2023-07-10: Environment Variable Refactoring

### Changes Made
- Removed hardcoded MongoDB connection strings from:
  - `app/database/connector.py`
  - `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`
  - `app/database/repositories/resume_repository.py`
  - `app/main.py`
  - `app/api/routers/resume.py`
- Created `.env.example` file to document required environment variables
- Created `PROJECT_LAYOUT.md` to document project structure
- Created this progress tracking file

### Benefits
- Improved security by removing hardcoded connection strings
- Better configuration management through environment variables
- Easier deployment to different environments
- Consistent approach to configuration across the application

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing a configuration service to centralize config management
- Add validation for required environment variables at startup
- Implement proper error handling for missing environment variables

## 2023-07-15: Temperature Slider for LLM Creativity Control

### Changes Made
1. **API Model Update**
   - Added temperature parameter to `OptimizeResumeRequest` model in `app/api/routers/resume.py`
   - Parameter is optional with a default value of 0.0
   - Added validation to ensure temperature is between 0.0 and 1.0

2. **AI Service Update**
   - Updated `AtsResumeOptimizer` class in `app/services/ai/model_ai.py` to accept temperature parameter
   - Modified `__init__` method to store temperature as an instance variable
   - Updated `_get_openai_model` method to use the temperature parameter when creating the LLM

3. **API Endpoint Update**
   - Modified `optimize_resume` function in `app/api/routers/resume.py` to pass temperature to the optimizer
   - Added logging of temperature value

4. **Frontend Update**
   - Added temperature slider to `app/templates/resume_optimize.html`
   - Added temperature property to Alpine.js component
   - Updated API call to include temperature parameter
   - Added UI labels and explanations for the temperature slider

### Benefits
- Users can now control the creativity level of the LLM when optimizing resumes
- Low values (0.0): More conservative, predictable results
- High values (1.0): More creative, varied results
- Provides more flexibility for different resume optimization scenarios

### Next Steps
- Consider adding temperature control to other LLM-powered features
- Add user preference saving for temperature settings
- Add more detailed explanation of temperature effects on resume optimization
