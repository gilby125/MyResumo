## 2023-07-10: Environment Variable Refactoring

### Changes Made
- Removed hardcoded MongoDB connection strings from:
  - `app/database/connector.py`
  - `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`
  - `app/database/repositories/resume_repository.py`
  - `app/main.py`
  - `app/api/routers/resume.py`
- Created `.env.example` file to document required environment variables

### Benefits
- Improved security by removing hardcoded connection strings
- Better configuration management through environment variables

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing a configuration service to centralize config management
- Add validation for required environment variables at startup
