  - `app/main.py`
  - `app/api/routers/resume.py`
- Created `.env.example` file to document required environment variables
- Created `PROJECT_LAYOUT.md` to document project structure
- Created this progress tracking file

### Benefits

   - Updated `ATSScorerLLM` class in `app/services/ai/ats_scoring.py` to accept temperature parameter
   - Modified `__init__` method to store temperature as an instance variable
   - Updated TokenTracker call to use the temperature parameter when creating the LLM
   - Updated `AtsResumeOptimizer` to pass temperature to `ATSScorerLLM`

3. **API Endpoint Update**
   - Modified `score_resume` function in `app/api/routers/resume.py` to pass temperature to the scorer
   - Added logging of temperature value

4. **Frontend Update**
   - Added temperature slider to the Score Resume modal in `app/templates/dashboard.html`
   - Added temperature property to the dashboardApp Alpine.js component
   - Updated API call to include temperature parameter
   - Added UI labels and explanations for the temperature slider

### Benefits
- Users can now control the creativity level of the LLM when scoring resumes
- Provides consistent temperature control across both scoring and optimization features
- Allows for more personalized resume analysis based on user preferences
- Improves user experience by providing more control over AI behavior

### Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on temperature settings to determine optimal defaults
- Consider adding temperature presets (e.g., "Conservative", "Balanced", "Creative")
- Add tooltips or help text to explain the impact of different temperature settings
- Consider adding temperature control to other LLM-powered features

## 2025-05-14: Fixed Prompts Editor Functionality

### Issue
The prompts editor page was encountering an error when updating prompts: 'bool' object has no attribute 'modified_count'. This was occurring in the `/api/prompts-direct` endpoint when trying to update prompts.

### Root Cause
In the `prompt_repository.py` file, the `update_prompt` and `delete_prompt` methods were trying to access a `modified_count` attribute on a boolean result returned from the base repository's `update_one` and `delete_one` methods. The base repository methods were correctly returning boolean values, but the prompt repository was expecting an object with a `modified_count` attribute.

### Solution
1. Modified the `update_prompt` method in `prompt_repository.py` to correctly handle the boolean result from `update_one`
2. Modified the `delete_prompt` method in `prompt_repository.py` to correctly handle the boolean result from `delete_one`
3. Simplified the error handling logic to directly return the boolean result

### Files Changed
- `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`

### Testing
The changes were tested by:
1. Accessing the prompts editor page at http://192.168.7.10:32811/prompts
2. Updating the MongoDB connection to point to the correct server (192.168.7.10:27017)
3. Initializing default prompts
4. Editing and saving a prompt

### Next Steps
- Monitor the application logs for any further errors related to the prompts functionality
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application

## 2023-05-15: Fixed Progress Indicator in Resume Scoring/Optimization Modal

### Issue
The progress indicator in the modal for scoring/optimizing resumes was not working correctly. The modal showed a static "Processing..." message with an animated progress bar that didn't reflect the actual progress of the operation.

### Root Cause
The scoring modal in the dashboard template was missing the progress simulation functionality that was present in the resume optimization page. The progress bar was using a simple animation instead of showing actual progress.

### Solution
1. Added progress-related properties to the Alpine.js component in dashboard.html:
   - `scoringProgress`: Tracks the progress percentage (0-100)
   - `scoringProgressMessage`: Displays the current operation being performed
   - `progressInterval`: Stores the interval ID for cleanup

2. Created a `startProgressSimulation()` function that:
   - Initializes progress at 0%
   - Incrementally updates progress with random increments
   - Updates progress messages based on the current progress percentage
   - Stops at 95% to wait for the actual completion

3. Updated the progress bar in the scoring modal to:
   - Show actual progress percentage
   - Change color and style based on progress
   - Display step-by-step progress indicators

4. Added proper cleanup of intervals:
   - When the modal is closed
   - When the operation completes (success or error)
   - When the page is unloaded or hidden

### Files Changed
- `app/templates/dashboard.html`

### Benefits
- Users now see a realistic progress indicator that provides feedback during the scoring/optimization process
- The progress bar shows actual progress with percentage
- Step indicators show which part of the process is currently being executed
- Improved user experience with more informative progress messages
- Consistent progress indication between the scoring modal and the optimization page

### Testing
The changes were tested by:
1. Accessing the dashboard at http://192.168.7.10:32811/dashboard
2. Clicking the "Score Resume" button on a resume
3. Entering a job description and submitting
4. Observing the progress indicator updating during the scoring process

### Next Steps
- Consider adding real-time progress updates from the backend instead of simulating progress
- Add more detailed progress steps to better reflect the actual operations being performed
- Implement progress indication for other long-running operations in the application
