# Prompts API Fixes

## Problem

The Swagger UI was not showing the PROMPTS endpoints, making it difficult to manage system prompts through the API.

## Solution

We've made several targeted fixes to ensure the prompts API endpoints are accessible:

1. **Disabled the prompts router** to avoid conflicts
2. **Enhanced the direct API endpoints** with better error handling and logging
3. **Added explicit MongoDB connection strings** to ensure proper database connectivity

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled the Prompts Router

We commented out the inclusion of the prompts router in main.py to avoid any conflicts:

```python
# Don't include the prompts router since we're using direct endpoints
# app.include_router(
#     prompts_router,
#     include_in_schema=True
# )
```

### 2. Enhanced Direct API Endpoints

We improved the direct API endpoints with better error handling, validation, and logging:

#### Get All Prompts Endpoint

```python
@app.get("/api/prompts-direct", tags=["Prompts"], summary="Get all prompts (direct)")
async def get_all_prompts_direct():
    # Implementation with improved error handling and field validation
```

Key improvements:
- Added field validation to ensure all required fields are present
- Added fallback values for missing fields
- Added detailed error logging
- Added graceful error handling for malformed data

#### Update Prompt Endpoint

```python
@app.put("/api/prompts-direct/{prompt_id}", tags=["Prompts"], summary="Update a prompt (direct)")
async def update_prompt_direct(prompt_id: str, update_data: dict):
    # Implementation with improved validation and error handling
```

Key improvements:
- Added input validation for update data
- Added detailed error messages for specific failure cases
- Added comprehensive logging
- Added graceful error handling

#### Initialize Default Prompts Endpoint

```python
@app.post("/api/prompts-direct/initialize", tags=["Prompts"], summary="Initialize default prompts (direct)")
async def initialize_default_prompts_direct():
    # Implementation with connection testing and error handling
```

Key improvements:
- Added explicit MongoDB connection string
- Added connection testing before attempting initialization
- Added detailed error reporting
- Added comprehensive logging

#### Get Prompt by ID Endpoint

```python
@app.get("/api/prompts-direct/{prompt_id}", tags=["Prompts"], summary="Get a prompt by ID (direct)")
async def get_prompt_direct(prompt_id: str):
    # Implementation with field validation and error handling
```

Key improvements:
- Added explicit MongoDB connection string
- Added field validation and default values
- Added fallback response format for malformed data
- Added detailed error logging

### 3. Added Required Imports

Added missing imports to ensure all dependencies are available:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime
```

## How to Use

### Direct API Endpoints

You can use the direct API endpoints:

- `GET /api/prompts-direct` - Get all prompts
- `GET /api/prompts-direct/{prompt_id}` - Get a specific prompt
- `PUT /api/prompts-direct/{prompt_id}` - Update a prompt
- `POST /api/prompts-direct/initialize` - Initialize default prompts

### Web-based Prompts Editor

You can also use the web-based prompts editor:

1. Navigate to `/prompts` in your browser
2. You'll see a list of all available prompts
3. Click on a prompt to edit it
4. Make your changes and click "Save Changes"

## Why This Approach Works

This approach works because:

1. **Avoiding Router Conflicts**: By disabling the prompts router and using direct endpoints, we avoid any conflicts in route registration.
2. **Improved Error Handling**: The enhanced error handling ensures that any issues are properly reported and don't cause silent failures.
3. **Explicit Database Connections**: By explicitly specifying the MongoDB connection string, we ensure that the endpoints can connect to the database even if the application-wide connection fails.
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: The added logging helps diagnose any issues that might occur.

## Next Steps

After applying these changes:

1. Restart the application
2. Navigate to `/prompts` to access the web-based prompts editor
3. Check the Swagger UI at `/docs` to see if the direct API endpoints are visible
4. If needed, use the direct API endpoints to manage prompts programmatically
