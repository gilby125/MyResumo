# Playwright MCP Testing for MyResumo

This document summarizes the Playwright Model Control Protocol (MCP) testing implemented for the MyResumo application.

## Test Files Created

1. **Basic UI Tests**
   - `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` - Tests for the dashboard page UI elements
   - `e2e/create-resume.spec.ts` - Tests for the resume creation page
   - `e2e/home.spec.ts` - Tests for the home/landing page
   - `e2e/prompts-editor.spec.ts` - Tests for the prompts editor page

2. **MCP-Specific Tests**
   - `e2e/mcp-test.spec.ts` - Basic MCP functionality tests
   - `e2e/advanced-mcp.spec.ts` - Advanced MCP functionality tests

## MCP Features Tested

### Basic MCP Features

- **Navigation**
  - Page navigation using `page.goto()`
  - Back/forward navigation using `page.goBack()` and `page.goForward()`
  - Waiting for page load states with `page.waitForLoadState()`

- **Element Interaction**
  - Clicking elements with `element.click()`
  - Filling form fields with `element.fill()`
  - Clearing form fields with `element.clear()`

- **Assertions**
  - Verifying page titles with `expect(page).toHaveTitle()`
  - Checking element visibility with `expect(element).toBeVisible()`
  - Verifying element attributes with `expect(element).toHaveAttribute()`
  - Checking input values with `expect(element).toHaveValue()`

- **Screenshots**
  - Taking full page screenshots with `page.screenshot()`

### Advanced MCP Features

- **Viewport Manipulation**
  - Resizing the browser window with `page.setViewportSize()`
  - Testing responsive design at different screen sizes

- **Element Screenshots**
  - Taking screenshots of specific elements with `element.screenshot()`

- **Dialog Handling**
  - Setting up dialog handlers with `page.on('dialog')`
  - Accepting dialogs with `dialog.accept()`

- **Network Monitoring**
  - Capturing network requests with `page.on('request')`
  - Analyzing API requests made by the application

- **Keyboard Navigation**
  - Focusing elements with `element.focus()`
  - Typing with `page.keyboard.type()`
  - Pressing specific keys with `page.keyboard.press()`

## Running the Tests

### Running All Tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Running Specific Test Files

```bash
npx playwright test e2e/dashboard.spec.ts
```

### Running Tests in a Specific Browser

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### Running Tests with UI Mode

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Viewing Test Reports

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Results

The MCP-specific tests are all passing in the Chromium browser. Some of the UI tests for pages that are not fully implemented yet are failing, which is expected. The WebKit browser requires additional system libraries that are currently missing on the test environment.

### Passing Tests

- All tests in `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts`
- All tests in `e2e/mcp-test.spec.ts`
- All tests in `e2e/advanced-mcp.spec.ts`
- Basic tests in `e2e/example.spec.ts`

### Failing Tests

Some tests are failing because they're looking for UI elements that don't exist yet or have different names/structures than expected:

- Tests for the create resume page (`e2e/create-resume.spec.ts`)
- Tests for the home page (`e2e/home.spec.ts`)
- Tests for the prompts editor page (`e2e/prompts-editor.spec.ts`)

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Add tests for the resume optimization process
   - Add tests for error handling and edge cases
   - Add tests for user authentication flows

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing
   - Implement test data management for consistent test scenarios
   - Add visual regression testing for UI components

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Implement load time measurements
   - Test application performance under various conditions

## Conclusion

The Playwright MCP provides a powerful and flexible way to test the MyResumo application. The implemented tests cover basic UI functionality and demonstrate various MCP capabilities for interacting with the application.
