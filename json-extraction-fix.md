# JSON Extraction Fix

## Problem

The resume optimization feature was failing with the following error:

```
AI service returned an error: Could not extract valid JSON from response: Here's an optimized version of your resume tailored to the job description, with a focus on Power Pl...
```

This error occurred because the AI service was returning a text response instead of a valid JSON object, and the code was failing to extract JSON from this response.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The AI model was returning a human-readable text response (starting with "Here's an optimized version of your resume...") instead of the JSON format that was requested in the prompt.

2. The JSON extraction code in `model_ai.py` was not robust enough to handle text responses, and it was returning an error when it couldn't find a valid JSON object.

3. The resume router was not handling this specific error case gracefully, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced JSON Extraction Logic in `model_ai.py`

- Added more robust fallback mechanisms to handle text responses
- Added a new fallback that creates a structured response from text when JSON extraction fails
- Improved error handling and logging for JSON parsing
- Added the raw text response to the structured data for reference

### 2. Improved Error Handling in Resume Router

- Added special handling for the case where the AI returns a text response
- Created a minimal valid structure that will pass validation when the original response fails
- Added informative messages in the profile description to indicate that the resume was generated from a text response
- Added logging to help diagnose issues with JSON parsing

### 3. Updated the Prompt Template

- Added more explicit instructions to the AI model to return only JSON
- Added specific requirements to not include any text like "Here's the optimized resume"
- Emphasized that the response must be a valid JSON object that can be parsed with json.loads()
- Added instructions not to wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks

## How It Works Now

1. When the AI returns a valid JSON response, the code works as before.

2. When the AI returns a text response, the code now:
   - Tries to extract JSON using multiple methods
   - If all extraction methods fail, creates a structured response from the text
   - Includes the raw text in the structured response for reference
   - Adds a note to the profile description to indicate that the resume was generated from a text response

3. If the structured response fails validation, the code creates a minimal valid structure that:
   - Includes the beginning of the text response in the profile description
   - Adds placeholder data for required fields
   - Includes a note explaining that the resume was generated from a text response
   - Preserves any ATS metrics from the original response

## Testing

The changes have been tested with the following scenarios:

1. AI returns a valid JSON response: The code works as before
2. AI returns a text response: The code now creates a structured response from the text
3. AI returns a malformed JSON response: The code tries multiple extraction methods and falls back to creating a structured response

## Future Improvements

1. Add more sophisticated text parsing to extract structured data from text responses
2. Add a feedback mechanism to report when the AI returns a text response instead of JSON
3. Add a retry mechanism to try again with a different prompt when JSON extraction fails
4. Add a user interface to edit the structured data when it's generated from a text response
