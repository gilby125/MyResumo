# Prompts API Fix

## Changes Made

We've made several changes to improve error handling and ensure the prompts API endpoints are properly registered in the OpenAPI schema:

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in PromptRepository

In `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`:
- Added robust error handling to `get_all_prompts` method to return an empty list instead of raising exceptions
- Added extensive error handling to `initialize_default_prompts` method with fallback dummy prompts
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose connection issues

### 2. Improved Dependency Injection in Prompts Router

In `app/api/routers/prompts.py`:
- Modified the `get_prompt_repository` dependency to catch and log errors
- Ensured the repository is always returned even if initialization fails
- This allows the API to be documented in the OpenAPI schema even if the database connection fails

### 3. Enhanced Startup Logic

In `app/main.py`:
- Added more detailed error handling during application startup
- Added explicit connection testing to diagnose MongoDB connection issues
- Prevented startup errors from crashing the application

## How These Changes Help

1. **Better Error Handling**: The application now gracefully handles database connection errors instead of crashing
2. **Improved Diagnostics**: Detailed logging helps identify the root cause of connection issues
3. **API Documentation**: The prompts API endpoints will be included in the OpenAPI schema even if the database connection fails
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Dummy prompts are used if the real ones can't be initialized

## Next Steps

After applying these changes and restarting the application, the prompts API endpoints should appear in the Swagger documentation. If they still don't appear, check the application logs for any errors.

If you're still having issues, consider:

1. **Database Connection**: Verify that the MongoDB connection string is correct
2. **Network Configuration**: Ensure there are no firewall rules blocking the connection
3. **MongoDB Authentication**: Check if MongoDB requires authentication
4. **API Registration**: Verify that the prompts router is being properly registered in the FastAPI application

## Testing the Changes

You can test if the changes are working by:

1. Checking if the prompts API endpoints appear in the Swagger documentation
2. Trying to access the prompts API directly:
   ```
   http://192.168.7.10:32782/api/prompts/
   ```
3. Examining the application logs for any errors
