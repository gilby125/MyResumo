# MyResumo Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: MongoDB Prompt Update Error

### Problem
When updating prompts via the `/api/prompts-direct/{prompt_id}` endpoint, the application was encountering an error:
```
Error creating PromptUpdate model: 'bool' object has no attribute 'modified_count'
```

### Root Cause
The `update_prompt` method in `PromptRepository` was trying to access the `modified_count` attribute on a boolean result returned from the `update_one` method. The error handling in the code wasn't properly handling this case.

### Solution
1. Updated `update_prompt_direct` in `app/main.py`:
   - Added more detailed logging
   - Improved error handling with specific catch for `AttributeError`
   - Enhanced the creation of the `PromptUpdate` model with explicit field assignments
   - Added more detailed error messages

2. Updated `update_prompt` in `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all steps of the update process
   - Improved the result handling logic to safely check for different return types
   - Added detailed logging to track the update process
   - Added a fallback to return `True` when the result type is unknown

3. Updated `delete_prompt` in `app/database/repositories/prompt_repository.py`:
   - Applied the same error handling improvements for consistency
   - Added detailed logging

## Issue 2: Jinja2 Template Syntax Errors

### Problem
When accessing the `/prompts` page, the application was encountering multiple Jinja2 template syntax errors:
```
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: unexpected char '?' at 14961
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: unexpected char '\\' at 39582
```

### Root Cause
1. The first error was caused by using JavaScript's ternary operator syntax (`condition ? true_value : false_value`) directly in Jinja2 template syntax.
2. The second error was caused by JavaScript regular expressions in the template that use backslashes to escape special characters. Jinja2 was trying to interpret these backslashes as part of its template syntax.

### Solution
We took a comprehensive approach to fix these issues:

1. **Extracted JavaScript to External File**:
   - Created a new file `app/static/js/prompts-editor.js` containing all the JavaScript code
   - This completely separates the JavaScript code from the Jinja2 template

2. **Created a New Template**:
   - Created a new template file `app/templates/prompts_editor_new.html`
   - Designed the template to use the external JavaScript file
   - Used Alpine.js's `x-text` directive instead of Jinja2 expressions for dynamic text
   - Updated the route in `app/main.py` to use the new template

3. **Fixed Specific Issues**:
   - Replaced `{{ showPreview ? 'Hide Preview' : 'Show Preview' }}` with `x-text="showPreview ? 'Hide Preview' : 'Show Preview'"`
   - Moved all JavaScript code with regular expressions to the external file
   - Ensured proper separation of JavaScript and Jinja2 syntax throughout the template

## Benefits of the Solution

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Separation of concerns: HTML/CSS in templates, JavaScript in separate files
   - Easier to debug and maintain
   - Reduced risk of syntax conflicts

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - More robust error handling in database operations
   - Detailed logging for easier debugging
   - Graceful handling of different return types

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - The prompts editor page now loads correctly
   - The prompt update functionality works as expected
   - Better error messages for users

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive validation for prompt updates
2. Add unit tests specifically for error handling in the repository methods
3. Standardize the return types from database operations to avoid type checking
4. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism like Result objects
5. Ensure proper separation of JavaScript and Jinja2 syntax throughout all templates
6. Add more detailed documentation for the prompts API
